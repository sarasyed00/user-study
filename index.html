    <p>You will go through two remote sessions where you will communicate with an individual who is trained in peer-support and discuss something that is troubling to you. During these sessions you will be asked to share a bit about this troubling issue and you will work with the peer to identify ways to reshape your thinking to help you see your issue in a new light. During one of these sessions you will communicate via a Zoom video meeting. During the other session you will communicate via an instant messaging platform. Afterwards you will be asked to fill out a brief survey about your experience. Each session and survey should take up to an hour of your time (for a total of up to 2 hours). You may choose to opt out of the study at any point, without penalty.

      After completion of the study you will receive a $40 Amazon gift card.

    <p>
We are researchers at Brown University's Human Computer Interaction Lab who are studying online peer-to-peer support systems.  Creating a connection to your peer is an important part of the efficacy of peer-support systems. As such, we want to learn how to better design internet based systems to improve user’s comfort with sharing and reciprocating, in order to better forge connections on online support systems. We also want to learn how to design for accessibility, so we are interested in involving both neurotypical individuals and individuals with Autism/Aspergers in our study.
